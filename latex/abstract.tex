Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are becoming more and more popular in the last few years.
Bitcoin combines classical ideas of distributed systems with powerful cryptographic techniques to solve the Byzantine Consensus problem and achieve eventual consistency on the serialization of valid transactions.
The main problem of Bitcoin is the possibility of forks, temporary inconsistencies in the blockchain which may allow an attacker to double spend its money under certain conditions.
In this thesis, we analyze some security properties of the Bitcoin protocol under adverse network conditions.
We implement an event driven simulator to test the low-level Bitcoin protocol used to build and maintain the network topology and propagate information about transactions and blocks.
Our results show that, while Bitcoin behaves well under normal conditions, it shows serious problems with large scale network attacks.
